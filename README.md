Whats MPI ?
Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a standardized and portable message-passing system designed by a group of researchers from academia and industry to function on a wide variety of parallel computers. The standard defines the syntax and semantics of a core of library routines useful to a wide range of users writing portable message-passing programs in different computer programming languages such as Fortran, C, C++ and Java. There are several well-tested and efficient implementations of MPI, including some that are free or in the public domain. These fostered the development of a parallel software industry, and encouraged development of portable and scalable large-scale parallel applications.

whats Mandelbrot set ?
The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers c for which the function f(z)=zÂ²+c does not diverge when iterated, i.e., for which the sequence f(0), f(f(0)), etc., remains bounded.
The set is closely related to Julia sets (which produce similarly complex shapes). Its definition and its name is the work of Adrien Douady, in tribute to the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot.[1]
Mandelbrot set images are made by sampling complex numbers and determining for each whether the result tends towards infinity when a particular mathematical operation is iterated on it. Treating the real and imaginary parts of each number as image coordinates, pixels are colored according to how rapidly the sequence diverges, if at all.
More precisely, the Mandelbrot set is the set of values of c in the complex plane for which the orbit of 0 under iteration of the quadratic map ...
